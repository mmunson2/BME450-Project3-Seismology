# Analysis:

##### Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map? Why do you see most of the earthquakes in that area?   

##### What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in these data?What is the average earthquake sizein this area?  

##### In the month of April 2015, where are the earthquakes mostly located? What event can you link these earthquakes to?
